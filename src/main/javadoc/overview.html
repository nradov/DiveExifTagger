<title>Dive EXIF Tagger</title>
</head>
<body>
	This is a command-line utility application for underwater photographers
	to automatically add EXIF tags to their image files with latitude, longitude,
	and/or altitude (depth) based on logged dive profiles and GPS tracks.
	It can read exported log files from a variety of common dive computers
	and GPS receivers. The main purpose was to assist with the
	<a href="http://www.baue.org/" target="_">Bay Area Underwater
		Explorers</a> (BAUE) geo-tagging project.
