		This is a command-line utility application to assist underwater
		photographers with adding EXIF tags to their image files with altitude
		(depth) based on logged dive profiles. It can read exported log files
		from a variety of common dive computers and update or create a GPS
		track log file. That track log can then be used for <a target="_"

			Explorers</a> (BAUE) Geo-Tagging Project.
