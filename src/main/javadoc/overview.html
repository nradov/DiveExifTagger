<title>Dive EXIF Tagger</title>

	<p>
		This is a command-line utility application for underwater
		photographers to automatically add EXIF tags to their image files with
		latitude, longitude, and/or altitude (depth) based on logged dive
		profiles and GPS tracks. It can read exported log files from a variety
		of common dive computers and GPS receivers. The main purpose was to
		assist with the <a href="http://www.baue.org/" target="_">Bay Area
			Underwater Explorers</a> (BAUE) Geo-Tagging Project.
	</p>
	<p>GPS receivers don't work underwater. So in order to record a GPS
		track the diver must either log the location before descending (or
		after surfacing), attach the receiver to a towed surface float, or put
		the receiver in a buoyant waterproof container and send it to the
		surface on a line during the dive.</p>
